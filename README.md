## Authors

Sagas are a concept I'm still working to wrap my head around, so this was great practice for them. Still getting use to the structure of generator functions and how they should be used to make api calls, but this project helped me understand the possibilities they have for improving our code in more advanced projects in the future.

My github and Linkedin are listed below.

Thanks again for checking out my project!
